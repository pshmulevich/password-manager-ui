How it works:


UI inputs to the service:

length
Master Password
Passphrase

Encryption:
I) Input MP is same as test-pwd
II) passphrase is the same as textToEncrypt
III) IVParameter spec is one of 2 hardcoded values

1) Add hardcoded salt to master password to make secret key
2) call encrypt(passphrase, secret key, hardcoded IVParameterspec)
3) Cut the return value using the length from the UI
